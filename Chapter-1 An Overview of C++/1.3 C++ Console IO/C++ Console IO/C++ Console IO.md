# C++ Console I/O Summary

C++ has evolved significantly since its inception. There are two primary versions of C++ that are commonly referenced:

1. **C++98/03**: The original standard versions of C++ which include the features and libraries that were standardized in 1998 and 2003.
2. **C++11 and beyond**: Modern C++ versions starting from C++11, which introduced many new features and improvements to the language.

## C++98/03

C++98 was the first standardized version of C++, followed by a minor update in 2003 known as C++03. These versions laid the foundation for the language and included features such as:

- Basic object-oriented programming support
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Exception handling
- Namespaces

## Modern C++ (C++11 and beyond)

Starting with C++11, the language has seen significant updates and enhancements. Some of the key features introduced in modern C++ versions include:

- **C++11**: Lambda expressions, auto keyword, nullptr, range-based for loops, smart pointers, and more.
- **C++14**: Binary literals, generic lambdas, and relaxed constexpr restrictions.
- **C++17**: std::optional, std::variant, std::any, and structured bindings.
- **C++20**: Concepts, ranges, coroutines, and modules.

Modern C++ aims to make the language more powerful, expressive, and easier to use while maintaining compatibility with older versions.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between these versions is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable C++ code. While C++98/03 provides a solid foundation, modern C++ versions offer advanced features that can significantly improve your programming experience.
