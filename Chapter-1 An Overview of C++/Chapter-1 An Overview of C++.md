# Chapter 1: An Overview of C++

## Introduction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It is known for its performance, efficiency, and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Key Features
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms.
- **Memory Management:** Offers both static and dynamic memory allocation.
- **Low-Level Manipulation:** Allows direct manipulation of hardware and memory, similar to C.

## Basic Syntax
Here is a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion
C++ is a powerful language that combines the efficiency of C with modern programming paradigms. It is widely used in software development, game development, and systems programming.
