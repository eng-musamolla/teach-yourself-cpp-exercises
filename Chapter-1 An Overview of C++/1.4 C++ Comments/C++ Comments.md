# How to Write Comments in C++

Comments are an essential part of writing readable and maintainable code. They help explain the purpose and functionality of code segments, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the code later. In C++, there are two types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

## Single-Line Comments

Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. They are typically used for brief explanations or notes.
