# Some Differences Between C & C++

## 1. Object-Oriented vs Procedural
- **C++**: Supports object-oriented programming (OOP) which includes classes and objects.
- **C**: Procedural programming language, does not support OOP.

## 2. Data Security
- **C++**: Provides data encapsulation through access specifiers (public, private, protected).
- **C**: No direct support for data encapsulation.

## 3. Function Overloading
- **C++**: Supports function overloading, allowing multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- **C**: Does not support function overloading.

## 4. Standard Template Library (STL)
- **C++**: Includes the Standard Template Library (STL) which provides a set of common classes and interfaces.
- **C**: No equivalent of STL.

## 5. Memory Management
- **C++**: Supports dynamic memory management using `new` and `delete` operators.
- **C**: Uses `malloc()` and `free()` functions for dynamic memory management.

## 6. Inline Functions
- **C++**: Supports inline functions to reduce function call overhead.
- **C**: Does not support inline functions directly.

## 7. Exception Handling
- **C++**: Provides built-in support for exception handling using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.
- **C**: Does not have built-in support for exception handling.

## 8. Namespace
- **C++**: Uses namespaces to avoid name conflicts.
- **C**: Does not support namespaces.

## 9. Reference Variables
- **C++**: Supports reference variables.
- **C**: Does not support reference variables.

## 10. Function Prototypes
- **C++**: Requires function prototypes.
- **C**: Function prototypes are optional.
