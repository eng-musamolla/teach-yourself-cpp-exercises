# C++ Keywords

C++ has a set of reserved words known as keywords. These keywords have special meanings and cannot be used for any other purpose, such as naming variables or functions. Here is a list of some common C++ keywords:

| `continue`| Skips the rest of the loop iteration. |
| `default` | Specifies the default branch in a switch statement. |
| `do`      | Starts a do-while loop. |
